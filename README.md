# GS Stuff
A repo for the analysis that was done for round 2 of interview

In order to recapitulate the analysis using the Makefile you will need the following installed on your computer beforehand:

* R v3.4.1
	* tidyverse
	* caret
	* randomForest
* Make v3.8.1
* ant v1.9.3
* [RDP classifier v 2.12](https://github.com/rdpstaff/classifier)


If these are installed typing the command:

`make report/interview_report.html` should re-run all the analysis
